##Introduction

A 1D deep convolution neural network (DCNN) model  was constructed for predicting the optical properties of CDs. This project includes raw data, model training, invoking trained model and other machine learning methods.

##Contributions

we hope other researchers add more experiment data into the original database, which can help to improve the robustness of the model in the future.

If someone wants to upload data to enrich our project, please process the data following the excel table provided in the data file.
